# Machine Learning
A repo to showcase practice of machine learning via python

Practice makes perfect but thats kind of hard on a windows system. Since windows
doesnt support most of the machine learning packages I will be using the Ubuntu
bash system built into windows 10. The drawback being that it doesnt have direct
access to the gpu. Neither does an installation via conda on an anaconda vm.

To get around this I'll be sshing onto an ubuntu system
Hopefully it works but for now that ssh machine will be set up

I'll work on something bigger later on :alien:
